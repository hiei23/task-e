# Project objectives
* Design a scheduler that allows prioritization of tasks based on user's input
* Prioritization is mainly based on number of hours needed, weight, and the deadline of the task.
* The application recommends a recommendation of which tasks need to be worked on, through an ordered list. 
* It aids the user in giving a clear view of the comparison of users' tasks and deadlines.

# Personas: 
* Alice is a university student, with a constant, decent amount of workload throughout her academic year. A lot of responsibilities is on her mind, always thinking about which task (eg. assignment, upcoming test, or an extra project) she should focus on next based on priority.

# Scenarios
* Alice's friend wants to meet up with Alice tonight. She wants to quickly check if she has enough time to get all her tasks done if she does meet her tonight. 
* Whenever Alice wants to take some free time, she is constantly stressed and wonders whether or not she should start the next task instead.
* Alice wants to make sure she is not forgetting any major or small tasks before any deadlines. 
* Alice wonders if her hours dedicated towards tasks are divided in the most efficient manner (eg. perhaps spending less time on an assignment and more on her essay would have resulted in an overall better gpa?). She wishes there was something to help filter out the most important tasks.
* Alice wants to keep track of how many hours she put in, but does not want to spend time manually filling it out every time.


# Principles
* Easy and quick input system
* Easy and quick access to all of the tasks laid out in a single screen 
* Ease the mind of the user with a clear view of his status (whether he is behind or ahead)
* Make time management less stressful and guide the user in his decision making
* Fewer user interaction and more automation
